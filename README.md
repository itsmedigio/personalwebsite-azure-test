# Welcome to the repository of the personal Website of Davide Di Giovanni

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)...

## GitHub Workflows Experiments

- This project gets built with GitHub Actions automatically at every commit/pull_request to master
- A production build gets created using the same actions and pushed to the itsmedigio.github.io repo
- You can see the output of the build at [https://itsmedigio.github.io](https://itsmedigio.github.io)
- If the Azure account that I'm using is still active, you can view the same website at [this link](https://salmon-sea-00adbae03.2.azurestaticapps.net)


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

### `npm run build`

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
